## 👋🏽 Hi! I am argentine-italian based at Buenos Aires 👩🏻‍🚀 

With a degree in Economics and over a decade of diverse experience, I have embarked on an exciting journey to pivot towards the technology sector and data-driven decision-making. As a highly accomplished Development and Fundraising specialist, I have successfully driven initiatives with esteemed organizations such as the Ministry of Culture of the City of Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacional de las Artes de Chile, Museo Moderno de Buenos Aires, collaborating and working with multinational and local corporations such as Total Energies, TEKA, Banco Santander, Fundación Santander, Banco Galicia, Fundación Itaú, among others.

My strategic approach, coupled with my ability to forge strong relationships, has consistently achieved impactful and enduring results through win-win alliances and cross-institutional teamwork, creating projects and content aimed at both mass and niche markets. 

In addition, I have also played a previous long role in the advertising film industry. For over seven years, I served as a producer, working with top brands and collaborating with international production houses for clients like Coca-Cola Intl, BMW, Stella Artois, La Redoute, BNP Paribas, Heineken, Cerveza Sol, Pantene, Cartier, Wrigley Company (MARS), among others.

While proud of my accomplishments in this realm, I am now seizing the opportunity to chart a new course.

I am eagerly embracing this shift as a <b>golpe de timón</b>, a decisive turning point in my career.

By combining my extensive background, I am poised to make a profound impact in driving innovation, shaping organizational strategies, social investigations and delivering tangible results.

Having a strong curiosity and experience in quickly recognising the core and functioning of a business,and in different topics of social and behavioral analysis, even as a junior on this new path, I I have a wide experience in aproaching the complexities of key indicators for maximising profits, and developing hypotheses of great interest on social matters.

Let's explore how we can level up your organization's success through accurate knowledge of your markets, clients, demand behavior, teams KPIs, and more, enabling the best data-driven decision-making.
